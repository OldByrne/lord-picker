Lord Picker
Spring boot and Angular web app for randomly choosing a Lord from the video game TWWH3.

Primary features:
User can click a button and a random LL will be picked for them to play as next.
Can filter in/out certain factions and/or lords.
Each faction/lord has strengths attached to them (good ranged, good cav etc). Can also filter on this.

Secondary features:
Other filters: Games and campaigns, DLC. (future)
Nice UI presenting the factions/lord with crests/portraits.
UI idea: dont have grid of faction icons. have just a button to random, waiting/countdown thing when pressed, then the lord portrait and info on top of a faction themed background.
Also have the filter menu pop in when clicked on. Use similar layout on this to Beddalla layout.
